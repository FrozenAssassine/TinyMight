# TinyMight
My own version of a digispark (TinyMight)

## What is that?
Basically, it's a Microchip running firmware, presenting itself as a USB device capable of mimicking functions like a mouse, keyboard, or joystick. It serves practical purposes like auto-clicking or acting as a device that inputs text on your PC. It's a useful tool for various tasks, enabling you to explore and have some fun with its capabilities.
